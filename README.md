# Calculator from scratch

I want to make a calculator that can do everything from addition  
to complex equations. The catch is that the only built in math stuff I'm  
allowed to use is the + and - oporators as well as the int class.  
This means I'll have to make a float class myself. This is meant to be  
more of a math AND coding project.

## dependencies

    - python3
    - nodeJS

## Python

I'm going to make the whole thing in python first just to get  
the concept down.

## NodeJS

Instead of using pygame like usual I'm thinking of making a localhost html-css-js  
webpage for the GUI. I'll either use node's VM module to run python as a  
sub-process in node, or just translate the python to JS and run it that way.

## Math Features

    - add (inclding floats)
    - subtract (inclding floats)
    - multiply (inclding floats)
    - divide (inclding floats)
    - exponents (inclding floats)
    - logarithms (inclding floats)
    - roots (inclding floats)
    - fractions
    - and more
